# Tasks — fork analysis backlog

Atomic, independently-actionable tasks. One file = one task. Ordered roughly
quick-wins → larger features.

These tasks are the **single source of truth** — the original per-fork analysis
plans were consolidated into them and removed. Each file is self-contained (source
fork, goal, steps with file refs, verification); the `> Source:` line names the
upstream fork the task derives from.

- [ ] [27 — Scope webview privileges (enableCommandUris + stop overwriting options)](27-scope-webview-privileges.md) — needs 18 §2a

## Marketplace / publication
- [x] [28 — Extension identity (publisher/name/author/repo)](28-extension-identity.md) — ✅ manifest done (vmarkd / spiochacz); publisher still needs `vsce login spiochacz`
- [x] [29 — Declare capabilities (untrusted / virtual workspaces)](29-capabilities-declaration.md) — ✅ done (+FS-write guards)

## Pro / i18n (engines bump — see note)
- [ ] [30 — Localization (l10n + package.nls.json)](30-localization-l10n.md) — ⚠️ ~^1.73
- [ ] [31 — Opt-in telemetry (createTelemetryLogger)](31-opt-in-telemetry.md) — ⚪ ~^1.75, only if metrics wanted

## Engines-bump features (tradeoff: cuts older VS Code)
- [x] [33 — ThemeIcon on the editor tab](33-themeicon-tab.md) — ✅ done; **engines floor now ^1.110** (30/31/34 free)
- [ ] [34 — Secondary-sidebar TOC](34-secondary-sidebar-toc.md) — ⚠️ ^1.106; overlaps 07/08/13 (decide outline home)

## Performance (open latency + memory)
- [x] [37 — retainContextWhenHidden memory dial](37-retain-hidden-memory-dial.md) — ✅ done as a **setting** `retainHiddenEditors` (default **on** — reload-on-reshow tested too disruptive for default)
- [ ] [41 — Bounded retain-cache for hidden webviews (keep N)](41-retain-hidden-webview-cache.md) — the real memory fix (instant for hot set, no jarring reload); ⚠️ needs testing
- [ ] [38 — Inline init content (skip `ready` roundtrip)](38-inline-init-content.md) — 🟥 HIGH perceived latency
- [ ] [39 — Lean Vditor init (gate renderers on content)](39-lean-vditor-init.md) — 🟧 MED; feeds VSIX trim
- [x] [40 — Drop unused MathJax (~6.5 MB)](40-drop-unused-mathjax.md) — ✅ done (KaTeX-only; guard in Foyfile + test)
- [x] [42 — Rendering profiling harness](42-rendering-profiling-harness.md) — ✅ done (setting `profiling` → `vMarkd Perf` channel); **measurement run still manual** — confirms renderText regex / debounce / setValue hypotheses
- See also: **20** (bundle is 94 % Vditor), **24 §5/§5b** (VSIX trim + Vditor asset-sync hazard), **11** (activation), **18 §2a** (streaming + keep media root)

## ⚠️ Performance / memory cautions (do carefully or defer)
Grounded in the open-latency + memory research. **Key multiplier:**
`retainContextWhenHidden` keeps *every hidden editor's* webview fully in memory,
so any feature that retains per-editor state (indexes, candidate lists, diff
state, outlines) is multiplied by the number of open editors. Until **37**
(dispose-on-hide) lands, memory-heavy features hurt most. Also avoid synchronous
work at open (`ready`) and continuous webview re-rendering.

**🟥 Avoid by default / gate behind an off-by-default flag:**
- **17 — Git gutters** — re-renders diff markers on every `update`, mode switch
  **and window resize**, with absolute per-block positioning (reflow); per-editor
  diff scheduler + `git HEAD` reads + `diff` dep. Steady CPU during edit/scroll.
- **32 — Link/image autocomplete** — `workspace.findFiles('**/*.{md,…}')` at every
  `ready` (open-latency hit) + a per-editor `FileSystemWatcher` + candidate lists
  retained in memory (×open editors). If built: lazy on trigger (not on ready),
  cap results, share one index.
- **23 — Wikilinks resolution** — custom renderer runs a `[[…]]` regex on *every*
  text token on *every* render, plus a workspace `.md` index kept fresh. Ongoing
  render cost + index memory. (Partially already in `custom-renderer.ts`.)

**🟧 Moderate — fine with mitigation:**
- **34 — Secondary-sidebar TOC** — extra view synced on every doc change (double
  outline render); overlaps 07/08/13 — pick one outline home first.
- **13 — Outline + heading flash** — outline rebuild on change; **debounce** or it
  costs per keystroke. The flash is cosmetic.
- **22 — Image resize** — per-image handles/observers (only when images present).

**🟦 These IMPROVE perf — prioritise, don't avoid:** **38** (inline init → fewer
round-trips), **39** (lean init), **37** (dispose-on-hide → less memory; the cure
for `retainContextWhenHidden`), **40** ✅ done.

**🟩 Perf-neutral** (safe to batch): 02, 03, 09, 12, 14, 15/16 (on-demand only —
**17** is what turns 15 into a continuous cost), 25, 26, 29, 30, 31, 33, 35.

## Infra / refactor
- [x] [19 — Replace user-event with native keyboard](19-replace-user-event-native-keyboard.md) — ✅ done in 0.2.33
- [ ] [20 — Tree-shake Vditor source import](20-tree-shake-vditor-source-import.md) — separate branch
- [x] [21 — Backend tests (vitest + vscode-mock)](21-backend-tests-vitest.md) — ✅ done (vitest + vscode-mock, 41 tests)
- [ ] [24 — Proper CI/CD pipeline](24-ci-cd-pipeline.md) — PR test gate; one release path; deliberate version bump

## Dependencies between tasks
- **15 → 16, 17** — build the shared mapping module first.
- **07 / 08 / 13** — all touch the same outline panel; implement the panel config once.
- **12 ↔ 18 (2b)** — apply CSS sanitization to external CSS too.
- **12 ↔ 26** — share the `<style>`-swap reload mechanism; do them together.
- **18 §2a → 27** — narrow `localResourceRoots` before augmenting/scoping webview options.
- **25 / 26** — share the "register listener in `resolveCustomTextEditor` + postMessage" pattern.
- **14 → 21** — rename tracking becomes unit-testable once the vscode mock exists.
- **20 → 21** — `bundle-size.test.ts` ships with the tree-shake work.
- **32 ↔ 23** — generalizes the wiki `pageKeys` suggestion plumbing to links/images.
- **34 vs 07/08/13** — secondary-sidebar TOC overlaps the in-webview outline; pick one outline home first.
- **35 ↔ 02** — reading time derives from the word count; share it, don't recompute.
- **36 vs 10** — both add "open beside"; resolve the overlap before building (fold reuse/dedup into 10 or layer it).
- **33 → 30, 31, 34, 18 §2d** — taking ThemeIcon raises the engines floor to `^1.110`, making those bumps free (see Engines floor note).
- **37 ↔ 38** — synchronous init (38) makes dispose-on-hide (37) affordable; pair them.
- **39 → 40** — confirming MathJax is never fetched (KaTeX default) unlocks the 6.5 MB cut.
- **40 ↔ 24 §5** — MathJax drop is the largest item in the VSIX-hygiene cleanup.
- **18 §2a ↔ Vditor cdn** — narrowing roots must keep `media/` (Vditor's local asset base) or rendering breaks.

## Engines floor note
Current `engines.vscode` / `@types/vscode` = `^1.64`. The bump-requiring tasks have
**nested floors**, so the highest one selected sets the manifest minimum and makes
the rest free:

| Task | Min version |
|---|---|
| 30 — l10n | ~^1.73 |
| 18 §2d — LogOutputChannel | ~^1.74 |
| 31 — telemetry | ~^1.75 |
| 34 — secondary sidebar | ^1.106 |
| **33 — ThemeIcon** | **^1.110 (dominant)** |

If task **33** ships, set `engines`/`@types/vscode` to `^1.110` **once**; tasks 30, 31,
34, and 18 §2d then need no further bump. Verify the ~1.73/1.74/1.75 numbers against
the API docs before committing.

## Deferred / watch (blocked on upstream)
- **Visual Markdown diff** — `customEditorDiffs`
  (`resolveCustomEditorInlineDiff` / `…SideBySideDiff`), `documentDiff`
  (`workspace.getTextDiff`), and `diff/mergeEditorPriority` are **proposed API**, which
  the Marketplace rejects (`enabledApiProposals` is disallowed). The most attractive
  direction (WYSIWYG diff) is out of reach until these finalize. Watch
  [microsoft/vscode#138525](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/138525) and
  [#315174](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/315174); revisit when stable.

## Not split out (decisions carried over from the analysis)
- **aqz236 §5 (bun / i18n / restructure)** — "not a standalone task"; fold in
  organically. Skip bun (conflicts with task 20's esbuild `build.mjs`).
- **aqz236 §3 outline / better-md §2 outlinePosition** — merged into tasks 07 + 08.
- **Encoding / Text Encodings API (1.100)** — **not needed.** The editor persists via
  `WorkspaceEdit`/`applyEdit` + `document.save()` and reads via `document.getText()`,
  so VS Code already honors the document encoding (no `fs.writeFile(string)` path
  exists). Only revisit if new wiki pages must inherit a non-UTF-8 sibling encoding.
- **navigator/Node 22 (1.101), require.main/allocator (1.94)** — no env-detection in
  code; `sharp` is dev-only → not applicable.
- **Export HTML, image-folder picker (`showOpenDialog`), QuickPick `prompt` (1.108),
  side-by-side `supportsMultipleEditorsPerDocument`** — reviewed, deliberately not
  scheduled this round.

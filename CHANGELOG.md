# Changelog

All notable changes to this extension are documented here.

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), versions follow
[SemVer](https://semver.org/). This log covers the **fork** (renamed 2025-12-15);
versions ≤ 0.1.x are inherited from the upstream `zaaack/vscode-markdown-editor`
project and summarized at the bottom.

> Versioning policy: do **not** bump the version per change. Accumulate work under

## [Unreleased]

Work accumulated since 0.2.32 (the 0.3.x line) — not yet cut into a dated release.

### Added
- Search in the editor: `Ctrl/Cmd+F` wired to the webview find.
- Outline panel: navigation with click-to-flash, configurable width and side
  (`vmarkd.outline.position`), open-by-default, and a heading-level markers toggle.
- Markdown Outline sidebar: a clickable heading tree for the open file in the
  Explorer with click-to-scroll (`vmarkd.outline.treeView`) — a native VS Code
  view, separate from the in-editor outline panel above.
- Wiki-style `[[page]]` links: rendered as clickable chips that navigate
  (Ctrl/Cmd+click, or a plain click in preview) and offer to create the page when
  it's missing. An autocomplete dropdown on `[[` lists workspace pages by their
  original-case name (path-qualified when basenames collide). Enable and scope it
  with `vmarkd.wiki.enabled` / `vmarkd.wiki.root`.
- Reveal-in-source: "Open source to the side" and the toolbar "open in vs code"
  button jump to the caret's line in the text editor (exact Lute-caret mapping).
- Git gutters: added/modified change bars vs git HEAD in the visual editor.
- Status bar: estimated reading time, live word count, and a WYSIWYG/Source mode
  indicator.
- Open the visual editor to the side (`Open with markdown editor to the side`).
- External CSS files with live reload; `vmarkd.css.custom` is injected last so it wins.
- Live theme switching (follows the VS Code colour theme) and live config reload
  (settings apply without reopening the editor).
- Rename tracking — the editor follows files renamed/moved in the workspace.
- Tab-group awareness: dedupe vMarkd tabs and reuse on open-to-side.
- Undo/redo: intercept `Ctrl/Cmd+Z` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` in the webview
  and route them to Vditor's history engine.
- Appearance settings: highlight headings, heading-level markers, code-block line
  numbers, Mermaid theme, toolbar visibility, and a font size that follows VS
  Code's editor size by default.
- Code-block line numbers (opt-in) and a dark-theme code-block style.
- `vmarkd.theme.code` setting — pick the code-block syntax-highlight theme (73
  highlight.js styles) from VS Code settings; `auto` follows the light/dark theme.
  Applies live. Replaces the toolbar's code-theme picker.
- ThemeIcon on the editor tab; declared workspace-trust / virtual-workspace
  capabilities.
- True opt-in default editor for Markdown files (custom editor registered as
  `option`, not forced default).
- Playwright e2e harness covering the 9 table-editing hotkeys (`media-src/e2e/`).
- Configurable link-open behaviour (`vmarkd.editor.linkOpenWithModifier`): by
  default Ctrl/Cmd+click opens the link and a plain click edits it, consistently
  across IR / WYSIWYG / Split modes.
- Image upload: images pasted or dropped into the editor are saved into the
  workspace (folder set by `vmarkd.image.saveFolder`, e.g. `${projectRoot}/assets`)
  and can be auto-converted to WebP and downscaled to a max width
  (`vmarkd.image.format` / `vmarkd.image.quality` / `vmarkd.image.maxWidth`).
- About dialogs (English) for vMarkd and the bundled Vditor, surfacing the pinned
  Lute engine version.
- Status-bar marker for large documents ("Large md"), shown to the left of the
  word counter only when the incremental large-doc edit path is active.

### Changed
- Hide Vditor's preview action bar (`preview.actions: []`) — drops the
  Desktop/Tablet/Mobile device-width switch and the China-specific "copy for
  WeChat 公众号 / Zhihu" buttons, irrelevant in a VS Code markdown editor.
- Drop both theme pickers from the toolbar's "more" menu: the content-theme picker
  (VS Code manages the theme — content follows the editor colours) and the code-block
  syntax-highlight picker (now the `vmarkd.theme.code` setting instead).
- Unified icons on VS Code codicons: title-bar buttons use `$(markdown)` /
  `$(go-to-file)`; the in-webview Vditor toolbar is restyled to codicons via a
  generated override (24 codicons + 6 codicon-style customs for glyphs codicons
  lack — headings, indent/outdent, inline-code, insert-before/after).
- Split view (`sv`) scroll sync is heading-anchored instead of proportional:
  the section at the centre of the source pane stays aligned with the same
  section in the rendered pane (Vditor's proportional sync drifts).
- Tree-shake Vditor from source — webview bundle main.js ~310→261 KB (−16%).
- Native `KeyboardEvent` dispatch replaces `@testing-library/user-event`.
- Backend tests on vitest (host + pure webview helpers).
- Build toolchain: drop `foy` + `ts-node`; the build is now `node build.mjs`
  (plain Node ESM) with npm as the package manager. (Bun was trialled and reverted
  to keep tooling minimal.)
- Dev dependencies: TypeScript → 5.9, `@types/node` → 22 (matches the VS Code
  host's Node 22), vitest + coverage → 4.1.8. Declared `engines.node >=22` + `.nvmrc`.
- Vditor 3.11 integration brought fully working (the dependency is on 3.11.2).
- Minimum VS Code raised to ^1.110.
- Upgrade the Lute markdown engine: vendor and pin a prebuilt `lute.min.js` at an
  explicit commit (ahead of the version Vditor ships), built via `build.mjs`.
- Tab inside a code block now indents instead of escaping editor focus.
- Copy as HTML / Markdown is routed through the host clipboard so it works inside
  the webview sandbox.

### Fixed
- Source Control diffs open the built-in **text diff** again instead of the visual
  editor: ship a `configurationDefaults` association routing `git`-scheme markdown
  to `default` (VS Code has no API for "default editor except in diff mode").
- Reveal-in-source: the caret lands on the correct source line (content-matched,
  robust to Vditor reflow) instead of the file start.
- Editing gap: the table panel no longer reserves flow space under the caret.
- Vditor 3.11: provide `customWysiwygToolbar` to stop the init crash; drop
  unsupported Lute reverse renderers and correct lute access.
- Position the table panel at the clicked cell instead of pinned far-left.
- Skip the wiki custom renderer for non-wiki files.
- Wiki autocomplete: picking a page inserts its chip cleanly — it no longer
  swallows the next character, extends the link as you keep typing, or drops the
  caret at the start of the line; an existing page also stops flashing as missing
  (red) for a beat right after selection.
- Backspace removes a wiki-link chip when the caret sits immediately after it
  (previously blocked by the chip's trailing zero-width-space delimiter).
- The instant-paint preview renders wiki links as chips instead of raw `[[…]]`
  while the live editor warms up.
- Changing the Mermaid theme (`vmarkd.theme.mermaid`) re-themes diagrams live
  instead of re-initialising the editor — no more scroll-to-top jump on large docs.
- Toolbar clicks no longer jump a long document to the top when there is no caret
  (the focus/re-render previously reset the scroll position).
- The caret and scroll position are preserved across an external document update
  (an edit to the underlying file mid-session no longer resets the caret to the top).
- Minimal-diff write-back: blocks that reserialize unchanged keep their original
  bytes, so editing one block can't reflow whitespace in untouched blocks.
- Table fidelity: a `|` inside inline math/code no longer mangles the row, and
  editing one cell no longer reflows the spacing of untouched cells.
- Flush-on-save posts the live editor value on Ctrl/Cmd+S (Vditor's input throttle
  could otherwise save a stale version).
- Pasting code-like text into WYSIWYG detects a code block from its content
  instead of editor-specific clipboard markers.
- KaTeX renders resiliently (`strict:false` / `throwOnError:false`) instead of
  throwing on a single malformed formula.
- Fix a null-dereference crash in Vditor's list-toggle.
- Outline toolbar button no longer shows the active (blue) highlight on open when
  the outline panel is closed.
- Code-block line numbers now follow `vmarkd.editor.codeLineNumbers` in both
  directions — turning the setting off reliably removes the gutter, which could
  previously stay on once it had ever been enabled.
- The code-block syntax theme (`vmarkd.theme.code`) follows the current setting on
  open instead of briefly flashing a previously-used theme.
- Uploaded images display inline straight after upload (and the CSP `base-uri` no
  longer blocks them).
- Reference-style links (`[text][ref]`) no longer disappear in the rendered
  preview (a Lute walk returned `WalkStop` instead of `WalkContinue`).

### Security
- Bump `esbuild` 0.21 → 0.28 — clears the dev-server advisory
  (GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99; we were never exposed since the e2e harness uses its own
  `http.createServer`, not `esbuild.serve()`). CI now fails on moderate+
  vulnerabilities (`npm audit --audit-level=moderate` gate).
- Hardening: scoped filesystem roots, sanitized custom CSS, CSP + nonce on the
  webview, and levelled logging.
- Scope webview privileges (command URIs off; postMessage-only, audited).
- Remote images are off by default (`vmarkd.image.allowRemoteImages`), closing
  the `<img https>` / inline `style url()` exfiltration channel; CSP further
  hardened with `frame-src` / `object-src` / `base-uri 'none'`.

### Performance
- `retainContextWhenHidden` memory dial (`vmarkd.advanced.retainHidden`).
- Instant preview on open: the host pre-renders the document with Lute and shows a
  read-only preview plus a placeholder toolbar immediately, then swaps to the live
  editor seamlessly — the file appears at once instead of after Vditor loads.
  Toggle with `vmarkd.advanced.instantPreview`.
- Host pre-render cap raised 4 KB → 10 KB, so more pages get an instant
  full-document paint on open (worst-case first paint ~55 ms; see
  `npm run bench:prerender`).
- Drop unused MathJax (~6.5 MB) from the shipped Vditor assets (KaTeX is used).
- Debounce activation; drop the broad `onLanguage` activation event.
- Large-document IR editing no longer freezes: the webview owns the markdown
  serialize, and edits to large docs reserialize only the changed block
  (incremental, O(block) instead of O(whole doc)) with a full-serialize fallback
  and drift self-heal. A busy cursor covers the rare full reserialize.
- Stream very large files (~700 KB+) into the editor in chunks instead of one
  blocking render that could freeze for seconds; read-only with a spinner while it
  fills in. Auto-activates by size; toggle with `vmarkd.advanced.streamLargeFiles`.

### Removed
- Runtime dependencies: jQuery, jquery-confirm, lodash, date-fns,
  `@testing-library/user-event`, `@testing-library/dom`, `@babel/runtime-corejs3`.
- Build tooling: `foy`, `ts-node` (and a brief Bun trial).
- Dead dependencies: `sharp` (never wired up) and the unused `media-src`
  TypeScript dev-dependency.

### Documentation / packaging
- Fork ecosystem analysis turned into an actionable `tasks/` backlog
  (`tasks/README.md` — priority order, dependencies, status).
- VSIX hygiene: internal docs/tests excluded from the package (455→402 files).
- Adopt Biome (lint + format) — single-tool, tuned to the existing style, gating
  CI (`biome ci`).

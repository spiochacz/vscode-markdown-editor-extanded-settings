# Changelog

All notable changes to this extension are documented here.

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), versions follow
[SemVer](https://semver.org/). This log covers the **fork** (renamed 2025-12-15);
versions ≤ 0.1.x are inherited from the upstream `zaaack/vscode-markdown-editor`
project and summarized at the bottom.

> Versioning policy: do **not** bump the version per change. Accumulate work under
> `[Unreleased]` and bump once, at release time.

## [Unreleased]

Work accumulated since 0.2.32 — not yet released under a version number.

### Added
- True opt-in default editor for Markdown files (custom editor registered as
  `option`, not forced default).
- Playwright e2e harness covering the 9 table-editing hotkeys (`media-src/e2e/`).

### Changed
- Fix the editor code to fully support Vditor 3.11 (the dependency was already
  bumped to 3.11.2 in 0.2.7; this release makes the integration actually work).
- Replace `@testing-library/user-event` keyboard simulation with a native
  `KeyboardEvent` dispatcher (`media-src/src/table-hotkey.ts`).
- Replace jQuery with native DOM; replace jquery-confirm with a native `<dialog>`.
- Replace lodash with tested native helpers (`debounce`, `deep-merge`).
- Replace date-fns with a native `formatTimestamp` helper.

### Fixed
- Vditor 3.11: provide `customWysiwygToolbar` to stop the init crash.
- Vditor 3.11: drop unsupported Lute reverse renderers and correct lute access.
- Skip the wiki custom renderer for non-wiki files.
- Position the table panel at the clicked cell instead of pinned far-left.
- Remove an unused `t` import in `main.ts`.

### Removed
- Runtime dependencies: jQuery, jquery-confirm, lodash, date-fns,
  `@testing-library/user-event`, `@testing-library/dom`, `@babel/runtime-corejs3`.

### Documentation
- Fork ecosystem analysis consolidated into an actionable task backlog in `tasks/`
  — 23 independently-actionable tasks + `tasks/INDEX.md` (priority order,
  dependencies, status). The intermediate per-fork plan documents were folded into
  these tasks and removed.

> ⚠️ Most backlog features (image resize, Vditor tree-shake, word count, search
> keybinding, code-block line numbers, git gutters, reveal-in-source, etc.) are
> **planned, not yet implemented**. See `tasks/INDEX.md` for status.
